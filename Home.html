    <h2 style ="font-size: 2rem;">A few things about me:</h2>
    
    1 -- I have been working a lot over the year and thought a new challenge would be interesting.  I decided to learn about computers. 

    I then began to look at coding and decided on this class. It was a job that offered better hours and a chance to be mobile. I like living in Michigan but the winters are long.  

     I would like to enjoy the Michigan summer and avoid the February and March part of winter.</h2>

     <h2></h2>2 -- In the summer is it about the lakes, rivers and being outside. I can't wait to go boating or fishing and ignore my cell phone.</h2> 

     <h2></h2>3--Winter is for skiing, ice fishing, snow shoeing and hiking in the snow. So fare there is no ice, very little snow, and skiing is minimal at best unless you like the man made snow.  So what to do?  Go South for the warmth and enjoy no snow, ice, and cold?  Or go North in search of ice, snow, and skiing?
